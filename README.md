* __Fibonacci__

   Create an app that increments a number (starting with 1), to the next number in the Fibonacci sequence. When someone opens this file, they should see a number, and one button  [next number]. Clicking this button should increment the number to the next integer in the Fibonacci sequence.  


* __Stopwatch__

   Create a stopwatch app in the style of the Counter app. This app should display a number, initialized to 00:00:00. It should display two buttons, [start/stop], which starts and stops the stopwatch from incrementing, and [reset], which starts the clock over from the beginning. 


* __Carousel__

   Create an image carousel. This simple app should feature an image, along with two buttons [<] and [>], which cause the image to change the the previous or next, respectively.
